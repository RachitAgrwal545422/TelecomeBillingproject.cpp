# TelecomeBillingproject.cpp
Our first semester project is a mini Telecom billing system. It allows us to store data and perform various operations on it.


<br/>
//In this project we are giving these options to the person.
<ul>
     <li> L.        To get a list of all accounts.</li>
     <li> A.       For adding accounts.</li>
     <li> M.       To modify an account.</li>
     <li> S.        To search the details of an account.</li>
     <li> P.        To get the amount of an account.</li>
     <li>D.       To Delete an account.</li>
     <li>E.       To exit from the system.</li>
</ul>
    In case you print any  option other than these then it will inform you.<br/>
 <h4>#option(A).</h4>
    First it will ask you to enter the no of records you want to add.<br/>
    Then it will take the information of these accounts.<br/>
    To every account it will assign a account no that you will use for further operations.<br/>
    Your all data will be saved in .txt file named listofrec.txt.<br/>
 <h4>#option(L).</h4>
    It will show you a list of all accounts with their information so that you can see all accounts and compare them easily.<br/>
<h4> #option(S).</h4>
    Here you can search the details of any one of the account.<br/>
    Again for searching you should have account no. and name.<br/>
    then he will ask you to store it in .txt format or not press d for download or any number to exit data will be saved in searchedrec.txt.<br/>
<h4> #option(M).</h4>
    To modify a account you must have access to that account and for that you must have name and account no. of the account.<br/>
    Enter the right account no and name.<br/>
    Now you can access all information.<br/>
    If you enter the wrong information then it will give you operation to enter again or exit from the operation.<br/>
    You have to enter all the information again.<br/>
<h4> #option(P).</h4>
    I added this operation just for the convenience of user so that he can directly see the details of amount of the account holder.<br/>
    For this operation he/she must have account no. and name of the account holder.<br/>
<h4> #option(D).</h4>
    Suppose if a person does not want to have account in it then we have an option to delete account of the person so that we can add more accounts.<br/>
    Simply we must have account no and name of the account holder.<br/>
 <h4>#option(E).</h4>
    This operation is to exit from the project.<br/>
    Simply give output as E and you can exit.<br/>
<h4> #Wrong operation</h4>
    What if a person gives input as e?<br/>
    Then in that case it would simply show that you have entered wrong operation so please enter a right operation.<br/>
