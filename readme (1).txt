//In this project we are giving these options to the person.
    L.        To get a list of all accounts.
    A.       For adding accounts.
    M.       To modify an account.
    S.        To search the details of an account.
    P.        To get the amount of an account.
    D.       To Delete an account.
    E.       To exit from the system.
    In case you print any  option other than these then it will inform you.

 #option(A).
    First it will ask you to enter the no of records you want to add.
    Then it will take the information of these accounts.
    To every account it will assign a account no that you will use for further operations.
    Your all data will be saved in .txt file named listofrec.txt.
 #option(L).
    It will show you a list of all accounts with their information so that you can see all accounts and compare them easily.
 #option(S).
    Here you can search the details of any one of the account.
    Again for searching you should have account no. and name.
    then he will ask you to store it in .txt format or not press d for download or any number to exit data will be saved in searchedrec.txt.
 #option(M).
    To modify a account you must have access to that account and for that you must have name and account no. of the account.
    Enter the right account no and name.
    Now you can access all information.
    If you enter the wrong information then it will give you operation to enter again or exit from the operation.
    You have to enter all the information again.
 #option(P).
    I added this operation just for the convenience of user so that he can directly see the details of amount of the account holder.
    For this operation he/she must have account no. and name of the account holder.
 #option(D).
    Suppose if a person does not want to have account in it then we have an option to delete account of the person so that we can add more accounts.
    Simply we must have account no and name of the account holder.
 #option(E).
    This operation is to exit from the project.
    Simply give output as E and you can exit.
 #Wrong operation
    What if a person gives input as e?
    Then in that case it would simply show that you have entered wrong operation so please enter a right operation.
